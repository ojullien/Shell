# ##################################################################################################
# keyUsage:
#
# keyCertSign
#   - Subject public key is used to verify signatures on certificates
#   - This extension must only be used for CA certificates
#
# cRLSign
#   - Subject public key is to verify signatures on revocation information, such as a CRL
#   - This extension must only be used for CA certificates
#
# digitalSignature
#   - Certificate may be used to apply a digital signature
#   - Digital signatures are often used for entity authentication & data origin authentication with integrity
#
# nonRepudiation
#   - Certificate may be used to sign data as above but the certificate public key may be used to provide non-repudiation services
#   - This prevents the signing entity from falsely denying some action
#
# keyEncipherment
#   - Certificate may be used to encrypt a symmetric key which is then transferred to the target
#   - Target decrypts key, subsequently using it to encrypt & decrypt data between the entities
#
# dataEncipherment
#   - Certificate may be used to encrypt & decrypt actual application data
#
# keyAgreement
#   - Certificate enables use of a key agreement protocol to establish a symmetric key with a target
#   - Symmetric key may then be used to encrypt & decrypt data sent between the entities
#
# encipherOnly
#   - Public key used only for enciphering data while performing key agreement
#   - Req. KU: keyAgreement
#
# decipherOnly
#   - Public key used only for deciphering data while performing key agreement
#   -Req. KU: keyAgreement
